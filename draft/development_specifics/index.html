        <h1>Mozilla Firefox: Development Specifics</h1>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>This document discusses specifics related to Mozilla's <a href="../development_overview/">Firefox development model</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Discussion should take place on <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning">dev-planning</a> and changes
        should be submitted as
        <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/process-releases">pull requests on GitHub</a>.</p>


        <h2 id="repositories">Main Repositories</h2>

            <p><img src="img/repos.png"></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-central</h3>
                    <p>Just like the current repository</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-aurora</h3>
                    <p>Stabilize work done on mozilla-central for release</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-beta</h3>
                    <p>Fix any issues that come up during the beta
                      validation of the mozilla-aurora stabilization</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-release</h3>
                    <p>Repository for code to generate officially released
                    Firefox binaries</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

           <h3 id="repo-processes">Development vs Release</h3>
           <p>The repositories can generally be grouped into two overall
              processes:
              development and release.
              Project repositories and mozilla-central are part of the
              <em>development</em> process.
              The downstream repositories are part of the
              <em>release</em> process.</p>
           <p>This document mainly covers the release process. Details about
              project pages, feature tracking, and bug management are out of
              scope for this proposal and will be discussed soon.

        <h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>

        <h3 id="versioning-firefox">Firefox Versioning</h3>

        <p>Unless major issues are discovered with the scheme, this is how
        builds in the assorted repositories will identify themselves:</p>

        <p><img src="img/new_versions.png"></p>

        <p>
            The following considerations are reflected in the versioning scheme:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>No "pre" as there are known issues with sites sniffing
            builds as Palm Pre devices</li>
            <li>Ease of version comparisons between channels and releases</li>
            <li>Amount of changes required to existing tools and systems</li>
            <li>Ability to identify which channel a user is on from the build
            </li>
            <li>Beta and release versions should identify as the same version
            to make sure beta testing is valid and no last-minute issues are
            found due to a version change</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">
            We aren't using "a" and "b" as it would be confusing as it relates to <strong>a</strong>urora and <strong>b</strong>eta.
        </p>

        <h3 id="versioning-gecko">Gecko versioning</h3>
        <p>
            Gecko versioning will tie into Firefox versioning
            regardless of the Firefox version scheme above.
            For Firefox 5, the gecko version will be 5.0, for
            Firefox 6, 6.0, etc.
        </p>

        <a name="localization" /><h2 id="localization">Localization</h2>
        <p>Localization work will be split into similar repositories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/">https://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/</li></a>
            <li><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora">https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-beta">https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-beta</a></li>
            <li>l10n-release</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There will be 8 or so locales that track mozilla-central,
        localizing alongside en-US development. Other locales can track
        mozilla-central if they would like to as well but they won't be
        asked to explicitly.</p>

        <p>mozilla-central will be string frozen for en-US at the 
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-aurora merge point. <strong>No 
        en-US string changes will be allowed on mozilla-aurora</strong>. The
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-aurora merge date will happen on
        schedule so the string freeze should not come as a surprise.
        </p>
        <p>For locales that don't track mozilla-central, their work is done in
        l10n-aurora, which tracks mozilla-aurora. <strong>This means
        most locales have 6 weeks to complete their localizations</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="milestones">Schedule of Important Milestones</h2>

        <p>In general, each stage of the process (and activity pertaining to
        a particular version) lasts for 6 weeks.<p>
        <p><img src="img/6_weeks.png"></p>

        <p>Please do note that chemspills / rapid response updates are not
        reflected in these schedules and will be dealt with on an as-needed
         basis.</p>

        <h2 id="branching">Cloning Mechanics</h2>
        <p>The following describes the mozilla-central to mozilla-aurora mechanics. mozilla-aurora to mozilla-beta mechanics follow the same steps, with the exception of tagging (use BETA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i>), and versioning (strip off the a2 suffix).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Never delete the aurora repo, we need the history.</li>
            <li>Tag mozilla-central with AURORA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i>.
            <pre>
            hg tag -R mozilla-central AURORA_BASE_`date +%Y%m%d`
            hg out

            hg push
            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Tag and close old head on aurora.

            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Push from m-c to a new head on aurora.
            <pre>

        <h2 id="observations">General Observations</h2>
         <h3>Deferring work</h3>
         <p><strong>No work is deferred from upstream repos to downstream
            repos</strong>. If your feature / change isn't finished on
            mozilla-central, mozilla-aurora is <strong>not</strong>
            the place to fix it up. If there is outstanding work on
            mozilla-aurora <strong>do not plan</strong> to fix it in
            mozilla-beta. The clone / pull dates are published far in
            advance so there should be ample time to plan.
            <strong>
              If it's not ready it should be backed out or preffed off.
            </strong>
            There will be another release in 6-12 weeks for the fix to try
            to make it in again.</p>
         <h3>Time-based cloning</h3>
         <p>
            Cloning between repos <strong>will</strong> happen on schedule.
            Again, consistency is key. Groups will be able to plan and won't
            need to be intimately involved with the release process
            to know where fixes are and where fixes should be landed.
         </p>

         <h3>The merge between release repos should be automatic</h3>
         <p>
            When the time comes to merge upstream release repositories with
            downstream repositories we are essentially replacing the downstream
            repository with a copy of the upstream. Because the
            merge/clone should never fail and it happens on a set schedule it
            will likely be automated.
        </p>
        <h3>Preffing off / backing out happens after the clone</h3>
        <p>
           When cloning from mozilla-central to mozilla-aurora
           the backouts and pref offs take place on the mozilla-aurora
           repo. This allows mozilla-central to use the complete allotted time
           for development and utilizes mozilla-aurora's time for
           convergence.
